# Exercises
This guide explains the different exercises tracked by the app and how they function.

Here are the exercises currently supported:

- Bicep Curls
- Push-ups
- Squats
- Deadlift

All these exercises involve measuring angles by creating lines between certain points and using these lines to figure out the angles.

## Bicep Curls
The bicep curl exercise uses wrist and shoulder positions for tracking. Here's what happens:

It looks at how high your wrist is compared to your shoulder to count one curl. It also checks the angle of your wrist, elbow, and shoulder to make sure you're not cheating by keeping your arm too straight.

### How Your Arm Moves
The tracker checks how confident it is in the position of the wrist and shoulder. It watches how your arm moves to make sure it's accurate. Reps are counted when your arm goes back to where it started. There's also a little leeway in case your wrist isn't quite above your shoulder but still counts as a rep.

## Push-ups
Push-ups are tracked using your right elbow and your nose. Here's what's happening:

The focus is on the angle between your right wrist, right elbow, and right shoulder. It calculates this angle using math. It also makes sure your elbow goes both up and down, like it's supposed to, by looking at your nose.

### How Your Body Moves
The tracker looks at how sure it is about the position of your elbow and nose. It watches how your body moves to count your push-ups. Reps are added when your body completes a full up-and-down motion.

## Squats
Squats are tracked using your right knee and right hip positions. Here's how it works:

Similar to the other exercises, it pays attention to the angle between your right hip, right knee, and right ankle. It uses math to figure out this angle. It also checks if your hip and knee heights are close enough.

### How Your Body Moves
The tracker cares about how sure it is in the position of your knee and hip. It watches how you move to count your squats. Reps are counted when your body goes through a complete squat motion. It also lets a bit of wiggle room if your hip is close to your knee but still counts it as a rep.

## Deadlift
Deadlifts are tracked using your right elbow and right knee positions. Here's what's going on:

It's all about the angle between your right elbow and right knee. This angle is found using math with lines drawn from your elbow to your wrist and from your elbow to your shoulder.

### How Your Body Moves
The tracker checks how confident it is in the position of your elbow and knee. It follows your body's movement to count deadlifts accurately. Reps are counted when your body returns to its starting position. It also considers a bit of leeway when your elbow is close to your knee but still counts as a rep.
